The Lost Nexus
==============

Disclaimer: This was just done for fun and not representative of how I actually code. I did it for the Github pages hosting.

I did not wish to start from scratch so I modified heavily the code found in this tutorial: 
http://domscode.com/2013/05/07/1160/

I promised myself I would not spend more than a day on this so hence why.

If it were up to me, I would refactor a lot and start off with a more concrete approach to this but this was simply done for someone to hopefully cheer them up so pardon
the incredible amount of inside jokes and references.

Disclaimer 2: I do not guarantee it'll look good on all resolutions as it was only tested on Chrome and on my computer.
